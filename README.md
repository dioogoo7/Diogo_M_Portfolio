# Introduction

In this page I share a presentation of the projects I worked during the Data Analysis Program I am currently finishing at Career Foundry. The program is designed to cover all the skills, tools, and processes necessary to become a data analyst. Specifically, we covered topics such as:

* Preparing and Analysing Data
* Data Visualization & Storytelling
* Databases & SQL for Analysts
* Python Fundamentals for Data Analysts
* Exploratory Data Analysis & Dashboards
* Data Mining & Ethics

The presentation included in this repository includes links to code I have written, as well as visualitions and reports I have created. Have fun!
