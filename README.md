# Introduction

In this page I display some examples of the work I did during the Data Analysis Program at Career Foundry. The program is designed to cover all the skills, tools, and processes necessary to become a data analyst. Specifically, we covered topics such as:

* Preparing and Analysing Data
* Data Visualization & Storytelling
* Databases & SQL for Analysts
⋅⋅* Python Fundamentals for Data Analysts
⋅⋅* Exploratory Data Analysis & Dashboards
⋅⋅* Data Mining & Ethics

The program pushes for a truly hands-on approach which I found was a great way to learn. Furthermore, the work we do during the program is always contextualized in projects are very similar to what a data analyst finds in day-to-day job situation.
